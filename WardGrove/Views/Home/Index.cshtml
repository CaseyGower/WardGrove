    Ward Grove Christmas Tree Farm has been in our family
    since the 1830's. For many years the crops were cotton,
    soybeans, corn, truck farming and livestock. When Roy and
    Sue relocated to Jackson in 1986 the first Christmas trees
    were planted. In 1990, choose and cut sales began with a
    farm wagon at the center of operations. With the addition
    of our rustic cabin and mule-driven wagon rides in 1993,
    families began looking to our farm as an important
    Christmas tradition.
    <br />
    Our farm is still a family operation with Roy, Sue, Ricky,
    Emily, her husband Robbie, and Jesse still working on the
    farm. The next generation of Sam, Christie, Kevin, and
    Marian are waiting in the wings to join us.

<p>
    The emergence of the choose-and-cut Christmas tree industry in the southeast
    was based largely on the Virginia pine. The needles of this tree are soft,
    sometimes twisted, and range in length from 1.5 to 3 inches in length. This
    tree has a pleasant pine fragrance and good needle retention
